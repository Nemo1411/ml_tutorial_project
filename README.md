House Price Prediction Model
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. The dataset used for training and testing the model includes information about different properties, such as suburb, address, number of rooms, property type, price, and other relevant attributes.

Data
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing various features of properties sold in Melbourne. The key columns in the dataset include:

Suburb: The suburb where the property is located.
Address: The address of the property.
Rooms: The number of rooms in the property.
Type: The type of property (house, unit, etc.).
Price: The sale price of the property.
Method: The method of sale (e.g., auction, private sale).
SellerG: The selling agent.
Date: The date of sale.
Distance: The distance from the city center.
Postcode: The postcode of the property.
Additional features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, car spaces, land size, building area, year built, and council area.
Model Training
The model is trained using a neural network architecture. The training process includes:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for training.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Compiling the model with the appropriate optimizer and loss function.
Fitting the model to the training data over a specified number of epochs.
Results
The notebook includes visualizations of the training process, including loss and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics over epochs. The model's performance can be evaluated using the test dataset to predict house prices and compare them with actual prices.
